# Wine Quality Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the chemical properties of red and white wines to predict wine quality. It uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in the data and applies various machine learning algorithms to classify wine quality as "good" or "not good." The goal is to identify key factors affecting wine quality and build models for accurate prediction.
