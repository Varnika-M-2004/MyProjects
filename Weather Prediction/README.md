# Weather Prediction and Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes historical weather data from Seattle to explore patterns and relationships between meteorological variables. It combines Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with predictive modeling to provide insights and forecasts. Machine learning techniques such as Gaussian Naive Bayes and Decision Tree Classifier were applied to predict weather outcomes.
